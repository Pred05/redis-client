# Redis client

Lightweight redis GUI client write with Electron and React.

The project was initialized and build with *Electron forge*.

## Development prerequisites

First you have to install packages. 

`npm install`

Secondly launch the project.

`npm start`

And that's it to begin development :D

## Roadmap [here](docs/ROADMAP.md)

This app is in construction since the _6 march 2019_. To simplify the development i made a roadmap based on redis commands and your feedback.

This [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) can progress over time.

## About project

### Why
i'm a developper since 4 years professionaly and passionate by creation. Today i want to try something new with open source project. This is my first one.
 
Until now i have develop project only for me (private repository) or for my company. i think creation is better when it can be share!

It is my first time with electron but not with nodejs and React.

i work with redis and i haven't find any GUI client which respond to my expectations : simple and light. 

### What

Sexy devtool!
